This is the Unity3d based mini game project which I and my team pitched on Infomatrix-Asia 2019 and won 1st place in the catgeory "Computer graphics". 
The code was lost. However, there is the video of the project on youtube. Link = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztBXslcY2S4". The gameplay starts at 1:16.
